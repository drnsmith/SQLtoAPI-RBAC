# mydbnode
This project creates SQL queries to support several functional requirements, a business logic layer to have API for each functional requirement using NodeJS, tests and demonstrates results using Postman. It also practicse remote database connection and role-based access control.  
MySQL2 and PostgreSQL are both popular relational database management systems, but there are some differences between them.

Architecture MySQL2 is based on a client-server architecture, while PostgreSQL is based on a process architecture. This means that MySQL2 is faster at handling large volumes of data, while PostgreSQL is better at handling complex transactions and is generally considered to be more reliable.
Data Types MySQL2 and PostgreSQL support similar data types, such as integer, string, and boolean. However, PostgreSQL supports additional data types like arrays, ranges, and network addresses not supported in MySQL2.
Performance MySQL2 is generally considered faster than PostgreSQL, especially for read-heavy workloads. However, PostgreSQL has a reputation for being more reliable and consistent, especially for complex transactions.
SQL Compliance MySQL2 and PostgreSQL are both SQL-compliant, but there are some differences in their SQL syntax and capabilities. PostgreSQL is generally considered to have more advanced SQL features, such as support for window functions, common table expressions, and full-text search.
Licensing MySQL2 and PostgreSQL have different licensing models. MySQL2 is dual-licensed under the GPL and commercial licenses, while PostgreSQL is released under the open-source PostgreSQL License.
The choice between MySQL2 and PostgreSQL depends on the specific needs of the project. MySQL2 can be chosen if the project requires high performance and scalability. On the other hand, PostgreSQL may be the better choice if the project requires advanced SQL features, complex transactions, or reliability.
