### SQL to API: Functional APIs with Role-Based Access Control

**A modular and scalable backend system integrating secure authentication, role-based access control, and PostgreSQL database-driven RESTful APIs.**

#### Motivation 

The increasing complexity of modern web applications necessitates secure and efficient ways to manage data and user access. Traditional applications often face challenges such as:

- **Security Gaps**: Insufficient or improperly implemented user authentication and role-based access control can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability Issues**: Poorly designed APIs can become bottlenecks as applications grow.
- **Time-Consuming Integration**: Developers often need to spend significant time integrating databases with APIs and implementing security layers.

This project addresses these challenges by creating a modular and scalable API framework that integrates robust authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) with a PostgreSQL database. The goal is to provide a foundational solution that developers can easily adapt and extend for real-world applications, ensuring security, performance, and scalability.

#### Project Overview

**SQL to API: Functional APIs with Role-Based Access Control** is a full-stack project aimed at building a secure and scalable backend system using **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL**. It showcases the integration of database-driven RESTful APIs with advanced access management features, making it an excellent foundation for enterprise-grade applications.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Security First**:
   - Implement industry-standard authentication with hashed passwords and JWTs.
   - Incorporate role-based access control to regulate resource access based on user roles.

2. **Database-Centric Design**:
   - Use PostgreSQL as the relational database for storing user data and permissions.
   - Ensure efficient database queries and data handling.

3. **Modularity & Scalability**:
   - Structure the project for easy extension and scalability.
   - Provide a clean and reusable codebase for future enhancements.

4. **Practical Use Cases**:
   - Demonstrate the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations with role-based access restrictions.
   - Serve as a robust backend framework for any application requiring secure data handling.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorisation**: 
   - User registration and login with encrypted passwords.
   - JWT-based stateless authentication.
   - Role-based middleware to enforce permissions.

- **Database Management**:
   - Centralised data storage with a well-defined schema in PostgreSQL.
   - SQL schema provided for quick database setup.

- **RESTful Endpoints**:
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations, secured and optimized.
   - Separation of concerns for routing, middleware, and business logic.

- **Extensibility**:
   - Easily adaptable for different use cases, such as e-commerce, education, or financial applications.
